Capcity estimation

10000 hotels which has around 1 million rooms 
1 hotel - 100 rooms

On weekdays,65% of the rooms filled 
on weekedns ,90% of the rooms filled
average occupancy = 80% 

1 person books 1 day , 2 days , 4 days
average 2 nights

80% occupancy for 2 days

80*10^4/(2*100000)-4 TPS write 
86400 seconds in a day ~100000


QPS

100 query per second
10% will process payment as per funnel conversion priciple
out of 100 ,50% reach rooms page,25% reaches payment page,10% do payment 
So only 10% perform transaction out of 100 QPS
So QPS alsways 100 times the TPS

400 QPS read
4 TPS write
